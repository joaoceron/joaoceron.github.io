    title: About Me
    text: 'I&apos;m a post-doctoral network security researcher in the <a
    href="http://www.utwente.nl/ewi/dacs/"> Design and Analysis of
    Communication Systems (DACS)</a> group at the <a
    href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/"> Faculty of Electrical
    Engineering, Maths and Computer Science (EEMCS) </a> at the <a
    href="http://www.utwente.nl">University of Twente, The
    Netherlands.</a> <br> <br> Currently, I coordinate the activities
    of the <a href="http://www.sand-project.nl/">SAND </a> project
    that is supported by <a href="http://www.sidn.nl">SIDN</a>, <a
    href="http://www.utwente.nl">University of Twente</a>, and <a
    href="http://www.nlnetlabs.nl">NLNETLABS</a>.

    <br><br>My background is in applied network security research, in
    particular, to investigate malware behaviors. In my master s
    degree, I studied botnet tracking mechanisms using network flows
    and malware analysis. You can find my  master&apos;s thesis <a
    href="http://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/70238?locale-attribute=en">[here] </a>
    (in Portuguese only), however, we have published few papers with
    the result of that research, see  <a href="#papers"> papers</a>
    section. <br>

    During my Ph.D. I developed a malware analysis environment based
    on SDN (Software-Defined Networking). The idea is to manipulate
    the flows originated from malware to triggers unseen malware
    behaviors. You can find my Ph.D. thesis <a
    href="http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3141/tde-28022018-105426/en.php">[here]</a>
    (also in Portuguese), if you are interested check it out the <a
    href="#papers"> papers</a> section that we published associated
    with this subject. <br><br>

    Besides my research background, I used to work as a Security
    Analyst at <a href="http://www.cert.br/">Brazilian National
    CERT</a> where we handle computer security incidents associated
    with Brazilian network address space, including phishing, DDoS,
    malware, and misconfigured services used in amplification
    attacks.'
